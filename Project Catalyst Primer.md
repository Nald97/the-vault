There is a funding round every 3-4 months. In May we concluded Fund 8. We're now going into Fund 9. Find more about Fund 9 schedule here: https://cardanocataly.st/en/funds/ 

## Challenges
Each Fund has categories for proposals called challenges. You will find them in Ideascale as campaigns.

Here's an example challenge from Fund 8: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26433/about

This is a technical challenge, focused on this question: 
```
How can we create a positive developer experience that **helps the developer focus on building successful apps**?
```

Not all challenges are technical. For example the **Grow Afrıca, Grow Cardano** challenge: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26442/about

You can submit yours own proposals through [ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/community/login).
