## The Process 

The amount of information may seem overwhelming but the process is pretty straightforward. 

1 - You review proposals when it is time accoring to the PA-guide.
2 - vPAs review your proposals and categorize them into 3 bins: Excellent, Good, Filtered Out
3 - Rewards are calculated according to vPA reviews and you get rewards at the end of the Funding Round (September/October)

## Where to Start
The time for PAs to review proposals is 30th June - 14th July. Until then, the best thing you can do is learn. Start with [[Blockchain 101]].

Once you get a basic understanding of Blockchains, start learning about Cardano: [[Cardano 101]]. 

Technical knowledge is not mandatory when doing PA work, but it will go a long way. Having a general knowledge about blockchain, tokens, NFTs, smart contracts will allow you to review technical proposals, which are more highly valued to review. If there is time until the review date when you read this, it is best to study these topics. 

Once you get a good grasp of the fundamentals, you can delve into what PA work means.

## How to Write Excellent Reviews
Once PA work starts, it's all about writing excellent reviews. Excellent reviews are rewarded **much more** so the better your review, the more money you make.

First thing is to read the Guide: https://bit.ly/Catalyst-PA-Guide

After that, you can browse through reviews from Fund 8 here: [Fund 8 Reviews](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1miayV-_dl8RJiRsMCovgb3m4hURrQOg7MREgBYGvjsU/edit?usp=sharing). You can copy this to your own drive to play with the data. 

In there you will find all Valid and Excluded assessments. Start by going through Excluded Assessments. These assessments were filtered out by vCAs/vPAs because they were not up to standards. See if you can tell why. Next go through Valid Assesments. Check which assessments were good and which were excellent.
