### Module 3: Cardano DAO Tools
![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 3: DAO Tools**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries:]]

#### Progress report
We're creating a map of DAO tools building on Cardano. Check the work so far [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_RtzWo6jtJjckcDsA15rvZeV87yAflYaomz24nSPtk/edit#gid=0). This is the MVP version of that document, which is the November milestone completed.

And a document to highlight some of that work here: [[DAO Tools Building on Cardano]]

[[Cogito Protocol]]: A deep dive into Cogito Protocol, an AI driven investment protocol DAOs can use to manage risk.
[[ISPO - What, Why, How?]]: ISPO is a funding mechanism to be used by DAOs. Here we investigate it and see when and where it's useful.
[[Mercurychat.io]]: A wallet to wallet chat tool you can integrate to your DAOs software in a few lines of code.

## Discussion
We're getting some good work done in these modules, though the end of year means we will have about 2 weeks off time. That will slow us down, though we will return next year booming. We will also need to focus on making all this information useful, so marketing will play an important role in the future.

In addition to the research work, we're holding workshops in littlefish Foundation to improve the ability of our community members to use our tools of work. We had 2 published sessions so far:
1. [Revamping littlefish Discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGKNsJd3yLw)
2. [Github for beginners session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMmUX2EGcGw)
