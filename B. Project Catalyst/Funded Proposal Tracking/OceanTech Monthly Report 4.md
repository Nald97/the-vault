## Progress this month

We could not focus on work for the first two weeks as most of our team members are based in Turkey and there was an earthquake which had a serious psychological effect on us. We continued our work 2 weeks after the disaster. We created a quality system for our documents to generate quality documents.

### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology
The work on vault quality documents and the earthquake delayed our work this month.

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We have done a deep dive into **COTI** this month.

#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
[[Coti]]: Coti is Â a **Layer-1 DAG-Based Blockchain Ecosystem** that has been optimized for payments, with the aim of completely transforming the payment industry.

We also created document guide and a quality levels document that are listed below:

## Discussion

We had a difficult and busy month. We created the Document Quality Levels and Document Guides and generated documents according to these rules. We also created a feedback process to increase document qualities.
