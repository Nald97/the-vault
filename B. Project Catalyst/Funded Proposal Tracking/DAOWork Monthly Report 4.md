![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 1: Wallets**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries#]]

#### Progress report
We have not focused on this module this month as we were focused on our littlefish Design Sprint and reorganization. We have completed the wallet comparison document to reach the **comprehensive** milestone but we will update it as it is not yet the end product. See all progress on [[wallets]].

### Module 2: Digital Work Tools
![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 2: Digital Work Tools**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries#]]

#### Progress report
We have not focused on this module this month due to the holiday season and the reasons of Design Sprint and reorganization.

### Module 3: Cardano DAO Tools
![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 3: DAO Tools**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries:]]

#### Progress report

With three reports from the last month and three from this month, we have in total 6 out of 10 deep dives into DAO tools. The research done this months on the tools are listed below:

[[Indigo Protocol]]: Indigo Protocol is an autonomous synthetics protocol built on Cardano. Not entirely a DAO tool but it can be useful for financial management of DAOs as Indigo Protocol can provide less-volatile store of value.
[[Roundtable v2]]: The new version of RoundTable supports both Multisig and Personal wallet.
[[Summon Platform]]: A service for communities that do not have experienced web3 developers to create and manage a DAO.

## Discussion

We had a rather quiet month due to the Christmas and New Year holidays and we have started a reorganization process with the new year. We have done an eight day Design Sprint face to face with five members of the littlefish Foundation. The reorganization and the Design Sprint have gave us a great future plan and a much more efficient working system.
We plan to revamp our documentation system to make them more visible and accessible for all the littlefish and the newcomers.
