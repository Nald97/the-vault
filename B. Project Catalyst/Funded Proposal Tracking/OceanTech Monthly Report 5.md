#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
- [[Kleoverse]]: This is a web3 work platform. Users can create professional portfolio on-chain.
- [[MicroChains Network]]: This is a cross-chain platform that allows transfer of assets between different blockchains.
- [[Ensuro]]: This is an on-chain insurance platform that works on Ethereum Blockchain. Although It is on Ethereum, it still can be used by the Cardano Community.
