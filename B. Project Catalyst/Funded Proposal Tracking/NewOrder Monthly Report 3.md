The team concluded the research of the second problem area this month: **3 - Legal frameworks for Decentralized Organizations**

You can find that document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWkk79LRLfhjWcM6VjV97wlQUv9jbnoO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105493237723142439851&rtpof=true&sd=true). The document will soon be put on the Vault after the reviews are completed.

Then the team will work on **1 - Legal status of LFF Action NFTs**

We had no workshops after the initial one. We will start back up in late March with a workshop on DAO Legal Frameworks.

## Discussion
This work has been slow so far. We're giving it more attention to speed it all up and get the proposal done by June at the latest.
