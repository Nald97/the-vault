**LFF General - Solving our own problems through experimentation, building applications the community loves**

Our approach to problem solving in this space is experimentation. Trying out new methods of doing business, creating new processes fit for a decentralized organization built from the ground floor.

  

One example is our Ikigai onboarding model. The bubbles at the top represent work groups and business functions. We walk through the bubbles with newcomers, discussing what they mean in Littlefish Foundation, and ask them to fill their Ikigai board with them. The result is a fun learning experience for everyone.

We create such systems with the aim of turning them into software. First we practice with existing tools, learn, iterate, and experiment, then we'll build it into software that others can use. See our Ikigai proposal [[Ikigai - Index]].

Some other experiments relating to publishing Actions by:

-   Financial tracking of [rewards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11rj_nNfQg98ePy3_2pp7YkiZc0WV47Dd-AgUf20fNZI/edit?usp=sharing)
-   Actions published on [#action](https://discord.gg/PKfAsQEhhS) Discord channel,
-   Older Actions published on the [Adventures of Littlefish](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOPNZgXQ=/?share_link_id=407306684536)

Success means these experiments turn into learning which turn into applications loved by the community.
  
**LFF General - A strong community of creators and builders**

We are a growing community of 100+. Yet pure numbers aren't enough. Growing the number of meaningful contributors is the key to long term success. Since the F8 proposal, the number of consistent contributors has grown from 2 to 10+ and growing fast. Newcomer numbers are also ticking up. Maintaining a sustainable, healthy growth in these numbers is critical.

**LFF General - Littlefish Vault is the knowledge hub for decentralized organizations in the Cardano Space**

Building a decentralized organization is tough. There are so many moving pieces, and time goes by quickly. By making our learning public we aim to make it easier for others to build decentralized organizations. A successful LFF means our knowledge base has become a popular place for others who are building decentralized organizations. Our target is 10000 unique and 1000 monthly visitors by the end of February 2023.

**THC - A technologically able organization: LFF**

The success of this proposal is primarily determined by how effective LFF as an organization has become in using digital work and blockchain tools. We need to solve our problems first, so that we can solve others’.


With success, team members feel comfortable using the tools of the work, using Obsidian and Miro extensively to collaborate and communicate. The organization has adopted multi-signature wallets to more effectively control funds. Littlefish feel safe when using their wallets.

**Organization Labs - The blueprint for decentralized organizations: LFF**

LFF is built on Teal organization principles. We value self-management, freedom of the individual, natural, dynamic hierarchies. We believe these principles will help us unlock new methods of human organization that are human-friendly. 

  

With success, LFF will become an example for other decentralized organizations, providing a blueprint with business processes, organizational challenges, experiments to run, along with many other resources.
