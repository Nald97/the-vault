## LFF Organization
LFF is a decentralized organization with a community. Our team mid June 2022 is made up of 17 people. The organization is growing day by day, as new community members show willingness to contribute, new connections are made, community members bring others onboard...  

As of June 15th 2022, we have 5 work groups, which are LFF [[5- The Basics - littlefish, colonies and Action|colonies]]. Each working group is responsible for different activities. You can learn about them [[Organizational Structure#LFF Sub-Colonies|here]].

## Load Management Through Commitments
Workload management in LFF is based on [[Modules]]. 

Each module has a team, responsible for the delivery of the module. Team members self select into modules by committing. 

Each member joins the team after they commit who define their own commitments to deliver part or all of the module. Commitments may be in the form of hours per week, per month, or related to a specific outcome of the module. 

It is up to each individual to define their commitments. Individuals commitments to modules will be available for everyone to view on the Modules page. Viewing through it, anyone will be able to see who is doing what, which modules need extra help, and who is overloaded. 

## Total Load Estimates
In total, the number of work hours listed in all LFF modules is significantly smaller than the number of total work hours available to be put in by team members. 

A rough calculation demonstrates this: 
-   Assume 6000 work hours listed in our proposals with
-   average target time of 6 months, 
-   with a total team size of 15. 
-   This nets an average of ~67 hours of work per month 
    
This amount of work per individual is akin to a part time job. Taking into account the strong recent growth in contributor numbers, this average will only decrease in the immediate future.

The numbers provided will be updated with concrete numbers to reflect full the workload once submissions close.

## Individual Loads
For individuals, the picture may be different. Some individuals may be overloaded, others not. Individuals will self manage their commitments through the module system, selecting modules to commit to. This information will be available here as proposals we adopt the module system across the LFF community.

We plan to display all total work commitments by each individual in the LFF team on our knowledge base in the coming months, as the module & commitment systems are adopted as organizational processes.

Information on hourly commitments to each module will be available for all to see at a glance, allowing newcomers to make their decisions on joining modules, and team members to decide if they have room for more commitments.
