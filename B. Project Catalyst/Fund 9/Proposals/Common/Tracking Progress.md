At Littlefish Foundation, everything we do is public, and we like documentation. We will publish major progress updates on Obsidian, sharing our learning with the Catalyst community. Our Miro boards are open to the community, there they can see our progress, comment, and contribute. Discord will be the best place to find daily updates, and Actions.

All LFF proposals produce Action, work done by individuals to achieve a goal. Until we have a [working system with NFTs](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414729), we will use Discord to broadcast our Actions. There are many examples already on the [#action](https://discord.gg/PKfAsQEhhS) channel, showing our early work. As our community grows, it will contain Actions taken by many different littlefish who are building the LFF.

We will track these posts specifically and incentivize team members and contributors to share their Actions, preparing them for Actions on the mainnet.

**LFF General - Community Tracking**

The general success of LFF is dependent on a strong community. We will track it from several sources:

-   on Obsidian using Google Analytics: number of visitors, average time spent, and multiple other metrics
-   by activity on Discord using server statistics bot: number of members, unique posters on discord per month, Action per month, Action per unique user


Weâ€™ll review this data monthly and share updates through our communication channels.
