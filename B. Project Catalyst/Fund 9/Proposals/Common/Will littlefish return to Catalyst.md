Yes, we will return to Catalyst for further funding, until we build sustainable business models around **Action**. Catalyst allows us to take our time, engineer systems well without rushing to market, potentially risking an event similar to what happened to Luna.


We are an evolving decentralized organization. We expect solid community and contributor growth in the near future. These individuals, along with existing ones who have time from existing commitments, will be starting new initiatives. Until we get to a sustainable business model using Actions, Catalyst will be the place where we come for funding. This allows us to experiment until we can figure our way. Thanks Catalyst!


We aim to become sustainable with the launch of our token on mainnet, which we tentatively aim to deliver by Q3 2023.Â 

Meanwhile, we will be providing Catalyst and the broader community with ongoing services. We will be publishing all our research (DAOs, governance, economic, technology, tools, ...) on the [Littlefish Vault](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/B.+Project+Catalyst/Fund+9/Fund+9+Start+Here). These will be made sustainable through experiments in Action, in due time.
