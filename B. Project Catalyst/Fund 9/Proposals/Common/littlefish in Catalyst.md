**Littlefish Foundation Kiva-like DAO** - Unfunded F7 Proposal

  

[https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384063](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384063)

  

Littlefish Foundation was born with this proposal from the Cardano4Climate community [2]. The aim was to create a DAO and build a Kiva like product that would allow the funding of on the ground SDG activities. 

  

The proposal wasn’t funded, but we kept working. We held weekly meetings, brought in experts for discussions, and worked hard to understand the domain of problems. Through that we’ve developed the idea further and generalized it to what it is today.

  

**Littlefish: Coordinating Action** - Funded F8 Proposal

In F8 we came up with a new vision for the Littlefish Foundation: littlefish, colonies and Actions. We got to work before it was even funded.

  

We were relatively new to developing on Cardano and found a steep learning curve. Weak documentation slowed development down, and we realized there was more to building a successful Littlefish Foundation. 

  

During this time we have completed many important steps:

-   Finished the [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_RIQxkM4DW2_J8mF8_spJzs8HbJH1PusJNK4b_ix8k/edit?usp=sharing)
-   Built a strong core of contributors from our community
-   Created an organizational model to fit our needs
	-   [[9- A Radical Method of Organization]]
	-   [[11- Why Cardano#Proposals Experiments and Teams]]
-   Formed work groups and started to produce on all of them. See these on the [Action Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7oL1M4=/?share_link_id=790505909394)
	-   [[Tech Help Collective]] - Working on wallet research&documentation, preliminary DAO tools research on Ethereum and Cardano, reworking Littlefish Discord
	-   [[Love House ]]- the littlefish AI art collection
	-   [[Organization Labs]] - Research on Teal organizations, determined necessary business functions, created organizational model
	-   [[The Forge]] - Tested out serialization library, lucid, and multiplatform library, created early UI/UX designs
	-   [[Dream Engine]] - Created Littlefish Action Model, User Flow Models, Detailed Action Flow, Organization Funding Model, and more

  
Here's a shot of that board as of the 10th June:

Our proposals in Fund 9 aim to supercharge this holistic vision of the Littlefish Foundation.
