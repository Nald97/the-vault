**Cem Karaca** - I completed a Master's degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering. My thesis was about creating a complete Video on Demand system with client-server architecture with its own network protocol called Reliable UDP. After graduating, I set up a high-security financial data center in 2004. Then, in 2019, I started a new cyber security startup with three of my staff. The same year, the startup was funded by the largest bank in Turkey. 

  

I started programming when I was 12 years old, and about 6 years later, I met the Internet, which introduced so many things to me. Open source was the biggest among them. Later on, I wrote a book about Linux and open-source systems. For me, open-source philosophy was the key to real human potential. It was making the secrets of the institutions public. 

  

In the corrupt financial system we are used to living in, a person or group named Satoshi designed the decentralized digital currency called Bitcoin. And afterward, new techniques that were not part of our current order began to develop. Then, in 2021, I met Cardano, where like-minded people find each other. So when I dig deeper into Cardano, I suddenly found myself in the Cardano4Climate community trying to do things to stop climate change with a bunch of people all around the world. 

  

With friends from Cardano4Climate, we formed the littlefish Foundation. It is a system, a reason for being. Encourage people to do anything for the good of the common. It is an experiment to build collective intelligence. 

  

Now, I decided to retire from all of my real-world business to solely think, dream and work for the littlefish Foundation.

**Engin Gunay** - 3+ years experience as a Systems Administrator / Cloud Engineer. Working in cloud orchestration security. Skilled in R language, Ansible and Linux. Enthusiast of emerging technologies and tools in blockchain. Former engineer in Computational Hydrogeology. Littlefish Foundation Tech researcher.

  

Proposal Focus: Module 1: Organizational research.

  

**Can Çetiner -** have 2+ years of architectural experience. I am currently working full time as a designer in an architectural office that designs buildings of various scales and serves in the field of landscape design and interior architecture. In the near future, I will continue my professional career in an office that I will establish myself.

  

My aim is to go beyond a company structure owned by a single person and create an architectural office that will be owned by all employees involved in every stage of the production. I am of the opinion that an office that gives equal rights to everyone, rather than an office environment that progresses in a standard boss-employee relationship, will be more productive and will offer all its employees the standards they deserve. In this way, it will be ensured that the architectural office does not progress with the vision of a single person, and the products that a collective effort will produce will be more beneficial for the society. An office environment with such an organizational structure will give all its members the chance to develop themselves and reveal their full potential. In this context, the office structure will be able to offer its employees opportunities to shape the present and the future of the company. I also work on sustainable economic models that ensure income justice, which I see as a necessity for an organization built on these values.

  

Proposal Focus: Module 1, 2: Internal processes of organizations.
