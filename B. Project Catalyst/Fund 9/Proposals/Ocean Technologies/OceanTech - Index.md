## Problem statement

Up-to-date, detailed information on cross-chain solutions, DAO enabling tools, and other technologies is difficult to reach. Opportunities to learn from others and collaborate never materialize.

## Summarize your solution to the problem.
A dedicated team of technical researchers, to curate, document, and update a knowledge base to serve as a gateway to up-to-date information about cross-chain and other technologies in the DAO space.

## Summarize your relevant experience.
A community of 100+ individuals and a dedicated team of 7 (growing) with 20+ years system administration expertise, specialized in highly secure PCI DSS systems. Experienced with learning new technical tools, writing documentation, teaching the technical to the non technical.

## Requested funds 40800 USD
**Ocean**: The realm of all blockchains, their communities, where all the fish swim.
**Note:** This proposal has a twin, focusing on the technology of the cross-chain. They were originally thought as a single proposal, but split to mitigate fundingÂ risk. See it [[OceanOrgs - Index|here]].
