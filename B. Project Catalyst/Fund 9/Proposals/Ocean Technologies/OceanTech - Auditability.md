**This Proposal - Docs and Curations**

It’s all about generating knowledge with this proposal. That means lots of docs and lots of links. We will publish them on our knowledge base. We will track the number of docs and curations generated per module and publish monthly updates through our communication channels.

## What does success for this project look like?

**This Proposal - Littlefish Vault, the Gateway to Collaboration**

Success for this proposal is the Littlefish Vault becoming the Gateway to Collaboration, where expert knowledge on decentralized organizations can be found, and connections with others who are focusing on similar problems can be made. 

The best indicators of success will be the use of our knowledge base, and feedback from users in our community channels. We aim to have 10000 unique and 1000 monthly visitors on The Vault by February 2023.


## Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.
