## Please describe what you will measure to track your project's progress, and how will you measure these?
![[Tracking Progress]]

**This Proposal - Software**

The outputs of this proposal are primarily code. Our repositories are open source, progress will be measured through git commits and important updates will be shared with the community through our communication channels. 

  

**This Proposal - Action, in action**

This proposal produces Action NFT. As part of the proposal we will develop a backend that reads data on-chain as its written. This means we’ll track how many Actions have been minted. The number of minted Actions is our first measurement of the success of Actions. 

  

We’ll build the system with users from LFF, gimbalabs, Sustainable ADA, c4c, and other communities. We’ll measure the number of unique users through unique addresses in the Actions minted.  

  

**This Proposal - Action use cases**

Actions are a general purpose earning solution. Their use is potentially limitless. We’ll measure use cases through the metadata, and real world interactions with users. Through collected data we’ll generalize the use cases into categories, measure their number, and report through our communication channels.

## What does success for this project look like?
![[A Successful LFF]]

**This Proposal - Actions are live on the mainnet, and are being used by colonies**

Once live, we imagine Actions being generated by many colonies, starting with LFF and adding other interested decentralized communities as colonies. We can't wait to see how Actions will be used by others. We aim to have onboarded 20 colonies with 1000 unique Actions minted by February.

  

**This Proposal - Actions are extensible, communities can easily add their own information**

Extensible Actions will bring flexibility to the system, allowing Actions to truly represent any activity that can be taken by individuals. Colonies will be able to represent data specific to themselves. Again, can’t wait!

## Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.
