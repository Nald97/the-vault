## Please describe your proposed solution.
This proposal is a LFF and [gimbalabs](https://gimbalabs.com/gimbalgrid) collaboration.

  

**The Problem**

Actions are the fundamental building blocks of the Littlefish Foundation. They are the NFTs, Proofs of Activity, that can be made to represent any activity in the real world. This is a broad definition that must be specified, designed, tested, and implemented.

  

To make it concrete, the first step is to define the metadata. There are many ways this can be done with each having cascading consequences that must be understood, tested for, and decided upon. The definition process must take into account updateability and interoperability.

  

In classical software systems, definitions of data evolve over time according to changing business demands. New data fields can be added, old ones changed or deleted. With NFTs (if not accounted for) data can't be updated. 

  

**Actions will stay the same**. Newer versions may have new information but this introduces an interoperability constraint. All clients that use this type of NFT would have to extend their support for it. This may become an untenable problem for 3rd party applications that want to use Actions.

  

**Our Approach** 

Hence the design process must account for this dichotomy. Our approach to solve this problem is to define Action incrementally with experimental steps. On the way, we'll be working with gimbalabs, c4c, Sustainable ADA, and other Catalyst colonies, discussing their use cases for Actions, generalizing to the needs of decentralized communities. These are the pioneers of crypto-native organizations. They will be the first users of Actions, along with LFF, [[The First Colony]]

  

**Outputs**

Our outputs will be:

-   an iteratively designed Action metadata specification
-   starting with a basic version 
-   adding features in stages as outlined in the plan. 
-   a minting smart contract.
-   a website with ability to mint Actions, view and browse them
-   A gimbalabs Project Based Learning Module on Actions

  

**Outcomes**

Actions are the foundation of a new, global, decentralized earning economy. With Actions, LFF and close communities will experiment in earning in new ways. As we expand the number of colonies, more and more Catalyst and Cardano communities, DAOs will experiment in Action, building a new global economy.

## Please describe how your proposed solution will address the Challenge that you have submitted it in.

**Alignment with the Challenge**

The challenge states

> Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different Dapps

> The more interesting and useful the products … the more reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations.

  

Littlefish Foundation is an original crypto native idea. It is an attempt to redefine existing earning relationships and replace it with a model that serves the people. Actions are at the heart of it.

  

Actions provide a new, **meaningful use case for NFTs.** They are a [new primitive](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/A.+Whitepaper/D.+Technology%26Philosophy/The+Attributes+of+Action) for web3. A broad, inclusive metadata definition that takes into account extensibility and flexibility will allow **new business models** based on reward sharing to emerge. It will also allow public/common goods to be valued through community funding.

  

This is what blockchains are meant to enable. Valuing what could not be valued before. Incentivizing publicly beneficial Actions through mechanism design. Actions will enrich the ecosystem like no existing current system can.

  

**Key Metrics**

The proposal improves the challenge Key Metrics:

-   Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.
-   Actions are an entirely new use case for NFTs. 
-   Actions will create new [[The Attributes of Action#New Ways To Earn|use cases for earning]]
-   Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community.
-   Actions will be built through use and feedback by LFF, c4c, Sustainable ADA, Gimbalabs and others.

## What are the main risks that could prevent you from delivering the project successfully and please explain how you will mitigate each risk?

**This proposal - Interest on Using the Tool**

To understand the problem at a deeper level, the needs of users, how they approach a tool like this etc. we will use the manual version on Miro. Through this we will collect information. This information is important for us to solve the problem effectively. If we don’t get enough people using the tool, our information won’t be as useful. To mitigate the problem we will be sharing the tool with other communities, getting completely different perspectives on how it can be used.
