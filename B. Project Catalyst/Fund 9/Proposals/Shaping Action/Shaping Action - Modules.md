#module #fund9  


The work outlined in the proposal is divided into modules, each a specific part of the development process. Much of the work follows an iterative design process. Actions will be tested in stages, feedback collected from users to further iterate on the design. 

  

Key milestones and expected deliveries:

-   September
	-   Action MVP specification
	-   Minting contract deployed on testnet
-   October
	-   Script to build Action MVP NFTs
-   November
	-   Extensibility MVP with colony membership Actions
-   February
	-   Ready for mainnet with extensibility, RSA metadata

  

**Module 1: Technical Specification**
Stakeholders: LFF, gimbalabs 
Primary Work Group: [[The Forge]]
Duration: July - January
Resources: 150hrs of work + operations budget

  

To start we have created an [informal specification](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/Action+Technical+Specification). This is an evolving document, bound to change with new findings and experimentation. It is to give a general, long term vision of Actions, designed both to spark discussion and to prioritize functional experimentation. This specification will be formalized as part of this module.

  

Activities:

-   **Metadata research**: What existing metadata specifications are there in the rest of the space? How do others approach the specification problem? In depth analysis of design choices. Common pitfalls.
-   **Metadata design**: Discussions on needs, prioritization of functionality, creating the JSON specification, formal documentation. 

  

**Module 2:**  **Minting Contract, Building Transactions, and Collecting Information**
Stakeholders: LFF, gimbalabs 
Primary Work Group: [[The Forge]]
Duration: July - January
Resources: 400hrs of work + operations budget + audit budget

  

Activities:

-   Write minting smart contract
-   Deploy minting smart contract 
-   Choose libraries to build transactions with
-   Implement automated transaction building
-   Developing scripts to collect on-chain Action information,
-   Backend, database development to collect on-chain Action data.
-   3rd party security audit of minting contract

  

**Module 3: Action Frontend**
Stakeholders: LFF, gimbalabs
Primary Work Group: [[The Forge]]
Duration: September - February
Resources: 150hrs of work + operations budget

  

The frontend must be able to populate fields for the Action metadata, sign transactions, and initiate transactions to mint Actions. 

  

Activities:

-   Design UI/UX for Action minting
-   Integrate wallet
-   Integrate with Backend (original LFF proposal)
-   Implement UI

  

**Module 4: Experimenting with Action**

Stakeholders: LFF, gimbalabs, c4c, Sustainable ADA, others Catalyst communities
Primary Work Group: [[Organization Labs]]
Duration: October - January
Resources: 150hrs of work + operations budget

  

Once we have the MVP Action and a working Frontend to connect the two, we can start experimenting with Action. We will use the system internally at LFF, to keep track of Actions that help build the LFF, including the activities in this and other LFF proposals. We’ll share it with other communities as a pilot program.

  

Activities:

-   Using Action in LFF internally, valuing work through Actions, first Action based payments made to littlefish.
-   C4c, gimbalabs, Sustainable ADA and others use Actions.
-   Collecting information from experiments.
-   Discussions on emerging use cases. What categorizations appear? What type of Actions are being generated? Is there demand? Who are the buyers?
-   Documenting, reporting on use cases.
-   Analysis of collected on-chain data, use cases.

  

**Module 5: Project Based Learning Module on Action** 
Stakeholders: LFF, gimbalabs 
Primary Work Group: gimbalabs
Duration: September - January
Resources: 300hrs of work + operations budget

  

As Gimbalabs developers contribute to Modules 1-4, they will be creating documentation and educational resources in real time. The outcome of this work is to create a Project-Based Learning experience that invites additional community members to use Actions, join Colonies, and contribute to the further development of Action infrastructure.

  

Activities:

-   Create Onboarding Module: Understand Actions and a colony
-   Create Building Background Knowledge (BBK) Modules: How are actions represented on chain
-   Create Contribution Modules that invite further development of Actions
