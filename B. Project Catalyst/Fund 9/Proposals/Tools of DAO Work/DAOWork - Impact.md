## Please describe your proposed solution.
**The Problem**

The speed of technological progress is blindingly fast. This is especially true in the blockchain space and Cardano is no different. New problems arise everyday, along with problem solvers who are tackling these problems. 

DAOs and more generally decentralized communities operating in the space can’t keep up with the developments. Which wallet should one use? What DAO enabling technologies are available? What multi-signature wallets, voting, governance tools are out there? At what stage? Are they usable? What are the unsolved problems? 

That is not all. There is also a mountain of tools that help enable digital work. These need to be adopted by individuals partaking in decentralized work. Decentralized work needs efficient scheduling, collaboration, and communication apps to work effectively. Yet most don’t venture beyond collaborating on google docs.

There’s too much to know. The barriers to entry are too high for most digital communities.

**What is needed?**

The tools need to be understood and adopted by digital workers. A dedicated team with technical knowledge and practical skills of communicating technical information to non-technical users is necessary to find tools, test them, document them, and teach others. 

At LFF we are a digital community of 100+ with 15+ core team members from around the globe. We felt these needs building our community. We need to adopt these tools and use them widely within our organization. So do other communities. This is why [[Tech Help Collective]] (THC) was founded. 

**Tech Help Collective** 

THC is a [[2- The Basics - littlefish, colonies and Action|LFF colony]] a work group of the LFF. It is a community for individuals who want to provide these types of services to the LFF and Catalyst communities. THC will grow over time. This growth will allow it to improve the quantity and quality of the work done, enabling others to stay on top of technological developments. The long term aim of THC is becoming **the community** in Catalyst to find the most up-to-date information on all things blockchain.

**Our Solution**

At THC we are a group of expert googlers, technology experts, and quick learners. To tackle the mentioned problems we will take these actions:

-   Research 
-   Solutions on Cardano: Personal wallets, multi-signature wallets, DAO tools, voting, governance, NFT marketplaces, DeFi protocols, …
-   Digital work tools: Scheduling tools, communication tools, collaboration tools, coordination tools, …
-   Test
-   Learning the tools through use, understanding the capabilities, limitations
-   Documentation
-   How to X? Wallet comparisons, DAO tools mappings and comparisons, videos and explainers
-   Evolving documentation published on Obsidian

**Who will benefit?**

THC acts based on the needs of LFF, solving problems in the domain of digital community building as they arise. The primary beneficiary of the activities of THC is this LFF. But these problems are experienced by all digital communities. Solving these problems for LFF, we solve it for other communities. We will share all of our findings with others, enabling communities in Catalyst and the Cardano space.

**Outcome**

The outcome of our work will be better functioning communities. Communities will have a better understanding of what tools are available to solve what problems, how these can be adopted, with examples in LFF showing how some are being used. This will increase the adoption of digital work tools and blockchain solutions, improving work efficiency in digital communities and increasing Cardano blockchain solutions’ adoption.

## Please describe how your proposed solution will address the Challenge that you have submitted it in.

**Alignment with the challenge**

The challenge states Cardano needs:

-   tools with better features and distinct advantages, 
-   Collaboration Management Platforms to organize community intentions and Actions,
-   tools for prospective organizations to use in evaluating Cardano DAOs

This proposal brings visibility to these needs, answering questions like what solutions are available, at what stage is their development, how do they compare to other solutions, and how to adopt them for internal use. 

The third point is at the heart of this proposal. Mapping out existing DAO tools with an evolving document methodology allows everyone to get up-to-date information about these tools. This helps in evaluating the stage of these technologies and drives adoption of quality projects.

**Key Metrics**

The proposal improves all challenge Key Metrics:

-   Number of Communities engaged in collaboration using Cardano DAO creation tools.
-   Better visibility will bring more adoption of these tools
-   Better understanding of digital work tools will increase efficiency and effectiveness of digital collaboration and thus engagement
-   Amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees
-   More knowledgeable communities -> more use -> more TX fees
-   Number of DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months.
-   Greater visibility into the Cardano DAO tool stack will enable communities to adopt these tools, increasing the number of DAOs that use Cardano
-   Number of DAO toolset/frameworks available 
-   Builders will have a place to view the information, seeing what is missing, prioritizing developments according to the needs of the space

## What are the main risks that could prevent you from delivering the project successfully and please explain how you will mitigate each risk?
[[Common Risks]]

**This proposal - Marketing** 

The success of the proposal depends highly on the spread of the information generated. If we don’t take this into account, all this proposal will accomplish is a better informed LFF and a few other communities. Information will diffuse through word of mouth activities but this will be slow and ineffective in capturing the attention of the larger community, if we don’t make additional efforts.

That’s why we’ll be undertaking additional marketing activities to spread the information we generate. We will share this information in other communities' communication channels. We’ll join meetings and talk about our work and how it can benefit others. 

We’re also growing the team at Love House, the LFF working group in charge of marketing, community building, and engagement. In time, we’ll have a strong team of content producers and storytellers who will create videos, short explainers, and talk to others about LFF and what we’re doing.
