  This proposal is run by the Dream Engine and The Forge [[Organizational Structure#LFF Sub-Colonies|work groups]] of LFF. 

  

This is a year-long proposal. The team required to deliver on the promises of this proposal will be crafted through the work outlined in it. 

  

In Module 1 we start building this team. We’ll start this part of the work early in July, promoting the learning cohort to build a **team of systems thinkers** with background in economics, game theory, computer science (algorithmic game theory), behavioral psychology, ethics, and other relevant fields. Through the learning cohort, we’ll have a solid core with a diverse background to tackle the problems.

  

And we already have a good start on that team:

  

**The Team**

**Cem** - I completed a Master's degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering. My thesis was about to create a complete Video on Demand system with client-server architecture with its own network protocol called Reliable UDP. After graduating, I set up a high-security financial data center in 2004. Then, in 2019, I started a new cyber security startup with three of my staff. The same year, the startup was funded by the largest bank in Turkey. 

  

I started programming when I was 12 years old, and about 6 years later, I met the Internet, which introduced so many things to me. Open source was the biggest among them. Later on, I wrote a book about Linux and open-source systems. For me, open-source philosophy was the key to real human potential. It was making the secrets of the institutions public. 

  

In the corrupt financial system we are used to living in, a person or group named Satoshi designed the decentralized digital currency called Bitcoin. And afterward, new techniques that were not part of our current order began to develop. Then, in 2021, I met Cardano, where like-minded people find each other. So when I dig deeper into Cardano, I suddenly found myself in the Cardano4Climate community trying to do things to stop climate change with a bunch of people all around the world. 

  

With friends from Cardano4Climate, we formed up littlefish Foundation. It is a system, a reason for being. Encourage people to do anything for the good of the common. It is an experiment to build collective intelligence. 

  

Now, I decided to retire from all of my real-world business to solely think, dream and work for the littlefish Foundation.
