## Please describe what you will measure to track your project's progress, and how will you measure these?
![[Tracking Progress]]

**This Proposal - A Diverse Team of Token Engineers**

The first indicator of success is the team we build to deliver the proposal. The first metric to measure this is the number of graduates from the Token Engineering Fundamentals and cadcad courses. Second, it is the number of unique contributors in modules 2, 3, 4, and 5. In code related work, we can see this through unique contributors on our github repositories. For other work, we’ll observe it through participation in workshops, token engineering meetings. 

  

**This Proposal - Delivering on Promises**

This is a research and development oriented proposal. There are many tangible parts to the proposal that will indicate success. In smart contract, off-chain, and frontend development, success will be measured through the delivery of features. How much of what we want to implement have we implemented? 

  

With token engineering and cadcad, our success will be in generating a robust token economy. This is a difficult thing to measure numerically. We’ll publish all our findings and ask others to review our work. We can measure success through feedback by other token engineers.

## What does success for this project look like?
![[A Successful LFF]]

**This Proposal - Littlefish Foundation, the blueprint for reward sharing organizations** 

LFF is built on Teal organization principles. We value self-management, freedom of the individual, natural, dynamic hierarchies. We believe these principles will help us unlock new methods of human organization that are human-friendly. 

  

A well engineered reward sharing mechanism is the glue that binds and supercharges this type of organization. With success, LFF will become the first of its kind, the blueprint for reward sharing can enable the next generation of organizations. 

  

**This Proposal - Catalyst and Cardano communities reward sharing**

Reward sharing will be designed to enable digital communities, DAOs, projects. Catalyst communities will be among the first users to run reward sharing schemes. With success, we’ll have 100 colonies using Actions and sharing rewards by the time this proposal is delivered.
  

**This Proposal - Actions are extensible, communities can easily add their own information**

Extensible Actions will bring flexibility to the system, allowing Actions to truly represent any activity that can be taken by individuals. Colonies will be able to represent data specific to themselves. Again, can’t wait!

## Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.
