## Please describe what you will measure to track your project's progress, and how will you measure these?
![[Tracking Progress]]
**This Proposal - Legal guidance documentation and the intangibles**

  

With this proposal, we deliver legal research specific to the conditions of LFF, Catalyst, DAOs and to other aforementioned problems that every blockchain community member already has faced or inevitably will face. We will track the visibility of these documents through Google Analytics including page views, unique visitors. 

  

Yet, this is a somewhat weak measure of the impact of this proposal. The very essence of the social sciences is its subjectiveness. It is challenging to precisely calculate the impact factor of our hard-work. The true measure is intangible. It lies in greater understanding of legal obligations for individuals and organizations, and the adjustments they make to comply with laws.

## What does success for this project look like?
![[A Successful LFF]]

**This Proposal - Legal standing of Actions is clear, developments are being tracked**

With success, the legal standing of Action NFTs to be used within the context of Littlefish Foundation Actions is clear, to the extent of available legal frameworks. Possible changes to the frameworks are being tracked, information is updated when the rules change.

  

**This Proposal - Earners in the space are assured about their earnings from Catalyst**

With success on this proposal, LFF members and other participants in Catalyst feel more comfortable about their earnings. If they have any obligations from their earnings, they are informed, if not, they are pleased. 

  

**This Proposal - LFF is aware of potential legal issues**

LFF is defining a new earning method and building technologies that enable the organizations of the future. The legal frameworks available are not fit for blockchain based earning. There are many potential issues, including future developments on legal frameworks for blockchain based earning. With success, LFF is aware of these issues, and takes the necessary steps to comply with laws.  

  

**This Proposal - Catalyst and blockchain communities are more aware of legal issues**

Projects, organizations, and individuals alike, from Catalyst and other blockchain communities are more aware of legal issues they face. They can make better decisions, know better which questions to ask, and have a better understanding of when they need legal consultation.

## Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.
