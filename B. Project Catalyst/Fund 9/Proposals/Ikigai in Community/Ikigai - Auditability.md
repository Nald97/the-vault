## Please describe what you will measure to track your project's progress, and how will you measure these?
![[Tracking Progress]]

**This proposal - Ikigai use case tracking**

As highlighted in the plan section of this proposal, we will collect information from internal and external use of the Ikigai tool, both pre-development and post-development stages. We will publish our findings, conclusions from discussions in public documents. 

  

**This proposal - Design and development progress tracking**

These are the more tangible parts of the proposal. Designs will be shared with the community as progress is made through the Action channel on Discord. Development already has the best indicator possible, git commits and working software. These will be public on our repository. We will also share development progress on the Action channel.
## What does success for this project look like?
![[A Successful LFF]]

**This Proposal - Ikigai unleashed**

Success for this proposal is Ikigai being used by many decentralized communities. By the end of development, we will at least have 3 communities including LFF using this tool. But real success would be a lot more communities using the tool for their needs. 10 communities using it is our immediate goal after launch with the 100 Ikigai filled on the platform.

  

We want our users to enjoy using the Ikigai tool and find it helpful to communicate and collaborate more effectively within and outside their communities. We want it to be something they’d like to share with others. Seeing that happen outside of the immediate circle of LFF would be success for this proposal.

## Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.
