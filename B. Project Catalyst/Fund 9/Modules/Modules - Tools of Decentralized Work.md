## Proposal
[[DAOWork - Index]]

#### Module 1: Wallets
Stakeholders: LFF, Catalyst and Cardano community
Primary Work Group: [Tech Help Collective](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Work+Groups/Tech+Help+Collective/Tech+Help+Collective)
Duration: July - February
Resources: 200hrs of work + module operations budget 

Cardano has more than 10 wallets actively being developed. The security, functionality, and usability of these wallets needs to be researched for individuals to make an informed decision about the wallets they’re using. Wallets are our interface with Cardano, it’s critical we all know how to use them, and use the very best for our needs.

Currently if you search for this information you’ll only find outdated documents. A wallet review from January is close to useless in this space. We’ll deep dive into these wallets, write documentation for each of them, keep on top of developments in the future, and evolve our documentation over time.

We’ve already started work on this project. You can see an example [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Work+Groups/Tech+Help+Collective/Wallets/Typhon).

Key Milestones and expected deliveries:
-   July
	-   3 wallet deep dives
-   August
	-   10 wallet deep dives
	-   Wallet comparison document MVP
-   September
    -   Comprehensive wallet comparison document
-   February
    -   50 docs + updates to all wallet docs

#### Module 2: Digital Work Tools
Stakeholders: LFF, Catalyst and Cardano community
Primary Work Group: Tech Help Collective
Duration: July - February
Resources: 600hrs of work + module operations budget

This is a broad category of tools that enables work in the digital. Anything related to communication, collaboration, and coordination in a digital work environment is included. 

We prioritize research according to the needs of LFF. LFF is a digital global community, so solving our problems will address the problems of many digital communities. Some early problems we’ll look into are: community enabling Discord bots, scheduling tools, and collaboration tools. We’ll also solve the problems of other communities, accepting requests to write docs to solve these problems.

We’ve already started tackling these problems. Discord we feel is a weak communication hub but it’s the place where the Catalyst community is. So we have to make it work the best it can for us. We’re looking into how bots can help with this, starting with creating direct communication channels with other Discord servers from the LFF server. You can find this and some of our other work [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Work+Groups/Tech+Help+Collective/Tech+Help+Collective).

Key Milestones and expected deliveries:
-   July
	- 5 digital tool related docs
-   August
    - 10 digital tool related docs  
	- LFF Tools of Work MVP: An intro to the complete set of tools we use at LFF. Start work on extensive documentation, how to’s, additional resources to learn. Examples [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Work+Groups/Tech+Help+Collective/Tech+Help+Collective).
-   September
    -   25 digital tool related docs
    -   10 community driven requests for docs 
-   December
    -   50 digital tool related docs
    -   10 community driven docs done
-   February
    - Map of decentralized work tools 
    - LFF Tools of Work: Complete docs on how to onboard to work on LFF. Anything you need is available as docs.
      
#### Module 3: DAO Tools
Stakeholders: LFF, Catalyst and Cardano community
Primary Work Group: Tech Help Collective
Duration: August - February
Resources: 600hrs of work + module operations budget
  
DAO tools are a broad category of technologies. A loose definition may also include digital work tools in this category but for us they refer to blockchain based solutions that solve problems DAOs face. Examples are community collaboration tools like dework, colony creation, operation (multi-sigs, wallets), and governance (voting, decision making) tools like aragon, daostack etc. 

The state of similar products in Cardano is not widely known. There is some good work being done by [ADAO](https://github.com/ADAOcommunity/round-table), [Liqwid Labs](https://github.com/Liqwid-Labs/agora) and others. These will be the types of technologies we’ll be researching in this area. 

We’ll first map out the ecosystem. Existing tools like [cardanocrowd](https://cardanocrowd.com/dapps) and [cardanocube](https://www.cardanocube.io/) will show the way. We’ll also look through past Catalyst proposals to identify tools being developed. Once identified, we’ll categorize solutions based on the problems they solve: governance, operations, communication, collaboration, … and create a map of tools.

We’re also researching similar tools on ETH and other chains to further our understanding of the use cases. You can see our related proposals [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/B.+Project+Catalyst/Fund+9/Fund+9+Start+Here). 

Once we have the map, we can start deep dives into the tools. We’ll select which tools to deep dive on by looking at the maturity of the product, the developer activity on the project, and community demand. We’ll prioritize solving problems we face at LFF.

Key Milestones and expected deliveries:
-   October
	-   Cardano DAO tools map MVP: Identify main categories, find projects working on each. Evolve in time.
-   December
	-   Deep dives into 10 different DAO tools
-   February 
    -   The most detailed Cardano DAO tools map available, with deep dives, and links to additional resources. We imagine this as the interface to Cardano DAO tools.
  
#### Module 4: Marketing
Stakeholders: LFF, Catalyst and Cardano community
Primary Work Group: [Love House](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Work+Groups/Organizational+Structure)
Duration: August - February
Resources: 60hrs of work + module operations budget

Marketing is a general module, shared by many LFF proposals. Its aim is to broadcast the knowledge generated in other modules far and wide. 

Activities:
-   Creating Twitter posts, 
-   Tracking engagement on Twitter and Obsidian (through google analytics), 
-   Spreading information in LFF and other community meetings. 

Key Milestones and expected deliveries:
-   December
	-   2500 unique visitors on The Vault
	-   10000 Tweet impressions (as of June 15th it is at 718) for [LFF account](https://twitter.com/LittleFishDAO)
-   February
	-   10000 unique visitors on The Vault
	-   1000 monthly visitors on The Vault
	-   50000 Tweet impressions
