One example of such a process is our Ikigai onboarding model. The bubbles at the top represent work groups and business functions. We walk through the bubbles with newcomers, discussing what they mean in Littlefish Foundation, and ask them to fill their Ikigai board with them. The result is a fun learning experience for everyone.

We create such systems with the aim of turning them into software. First we practice manually, iterate and experiment, then we'll build it into software that others can use through our platform.
