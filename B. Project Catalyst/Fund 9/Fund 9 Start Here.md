Welcome **littlefish**. We're glad you made it. 

You're freed from the nightmarishly boring platform that is Ideascale. We'll keep you warm until you're ready to go back. 

While you're here, you are free to explore the depths of the Littlefish Foundation, jump through hoops, dive into Littlefish Way#rabbitholes, and find connections. Whether you're a reviewer, a voter, or just a curious member of the Catalyst family, you are welcome here.
