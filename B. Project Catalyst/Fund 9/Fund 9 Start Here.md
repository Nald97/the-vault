Welcome **littlefish**. We're glad you made it. 

You're freed from the nightmare that is Ideascale. We'll keep you warm until you're ready to go back. 

Here, you are free to explore the depths of the Littlefish Foundation, jump through hoops, dive into rabbitholes, and find connections. Whether you're a reviewer, voter, or just someone curious, you are welcome here. 

All littlefish have a place in the Littlefish Foundation!

The Littlefish Foundation is **something new**. Things may not make too much sense out of the gate. That's OK. Take your time to explore and the all will be made clear.
