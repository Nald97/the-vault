# Managing Miro Boards
On a decentralized workspace, more often than not Miro Boards tend to get a little confusing. How many times have you come across a situation like this: "*Yesterday during the zoom meeting I was able to edit this board, but today I can't.*"

Well, this and other similar situations have to do with the **Role** that you have been assigned.

## Roles in Miro
The **Visitor** role. You know you are a **Visitor**, when you are invited to collaborate on a Miro board via a public link. In such case, you have access to edit the board but just for that instance (one-off session). Trying it again later won't have the same outcome. Being a visitor, doesn't require you to be registered. 

The **Guest** role. You know you are a **Guest**, when you are invited via email. In this case, you can only access the board that you have been invited to. This role allows you to return whenever you want and still be able to edit the board, unless the team administrator revokes your access. 
<u>*Note: You won't be able to see the board you are invited to on the dashboard, unless you **star** it.*</u>

The **Member** role. **Members** have full access on all the boards shared with them in a team. If you are a member, you can create your own board and content.
