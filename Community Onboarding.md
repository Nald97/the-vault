Welcome dear littlefish, we're glad you've decided to become an active part of our community. This document is your guide to all things littlefish Foundation, helping you get up to speed, and find the information you need to become a core member of our growing community.

If you find something that is not here, but you think should be, let us know in Discord so we can update this doc.

## What do we believe in around here?
If you're looking for a high level overview of all this, that is less reading based, see this Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPK4cSwQ=/

### The times we live in
At **littlefish Foundation** we believe the world today is deeply flawed. We can all feel it. There is something deeply unsettling about the things we're experiencing. Despite major technological advances, we live in times of extreme unhappiness, deep divides in societies, and under multiple existential threats.

This is the background of our endeavour: [[1- The Meta|The Meta]]

Within this meta, we believe the core problem is centralization of society. Good news is: we have reached peak centralization. Governments and mega-corporations which control large parts of modern life have reached their peak powers. With the [[2- The Digital and Beyond|digital revolution]] we now are reversing course. 

### How humanity organizes on the bleeding edge
With COVID, we believe the first signs of new methods of human organization have become clear: global, remote-first, and self-managing. With this we have tasted the first drops of freedom. 

This we believe was just the beginning. Instead of going back to our 9/5 desk jobs, we believe we can find new methods to organize human efforts. We believe the capacity of each individual, and their ability and willingness to take responsibility for themselves. We believe they can work with a new model where:
- each individual can become a leader
- individuals can work asynchronously, on their own time 
- individuals define their own role, commitment, responsibilities. They take on as much as they please.
- the world and the environment is in constant flux, it is ever dynamic, evolving, changing

All this is made clear in [[3- The Bleeding Edge of Organizations and the Big Problem|The Bleeding Edge of Organizations]].

### Building at the edge: littlefish Foundation
If that was not obvious by now, we're experimenting with this model of organization. Welcome to the experiment :)

We are not a company, not a business, not an NGO, not a governmental organization. We are an open source project, and a community of individuals collaborating together to build awesome stuff, for individuals like ourselves. We don't have bosses, yet we need to get things done. 

That is no easy thing and we don't claim to have the answers. All we're doing is running experiments: exploring the possibilities of human collaboration using and building new technologies. Solving for the problems we face, one step at a time.





### **Action** is the foundational key to all success
Woah what a great saying huh? It must have been some hot-shot who has said that. 

If actions are all that is, what 




It was Picasso btw. 

## I hear you saying: "This is awesome, how can I help?" 
Woah, woah, woah, slow down there. First we have to introduce you to the club. Then we identify your skills, 
Well, first we have to find out your strengths. 

Then we find your role ---> Ikigai

## Who are my clique?
Oh wow you've made it all the way here. You really are interested aren't you? Great to hear, let's give you the grand tour. littlefish Foundation is made up of 5 groups: 

[[The Forge]] - The builders of littlefish Foundation. Developers, designers, token engineers, the hard working grunts who make the coolest stuff on the planet.
[[Love House]] -  The home of happy humans who love sharing stories, making everyone feel nice and fuzzy. Community builders, communicators, facilitators, content producers, promoters are all at home here.
[[Tech Help Collective]] - The world is confusing to the non-technical person. All this technology around us and nobody to help us understand it. No longer. The THC is here to help.
[[Organization Labs]] - It ain't easy being on the bleeding edge of organizations. How do we organize in this wild west is the business of OrgLabs. If you fashion yourself an organization designer, this is the place to be. 
[[Dream Engine]] - Dreams are the beginning and end of all we build here. littlefish Foundation began with dreams and it shall only continue insofar as the littlefish who make it remain avid dreamers. This is the home of philosophers, visionaries, and oracles.
