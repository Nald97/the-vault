LFF is a decentralized organization with a community. As of June 15th the team is currently made up of 17 people. The organization is growing day by day, as new community members show willingness to contribute on a consistent basis.

LFF is built on Teal organization principles:
-   Distributed decision-making     
-   Natural, fluid hierarchies 
-   Self-management of participants

## LFF Sub-Colonies  
Littlefish Foundation is made up of five colonies, work groups of the LFF. Each has their own objectives and responsibilities. Collectively they make up the LFF. here
- [[Tech Help Collective]]
- [[Love House]]
- [[Dream Engine]]
- [[Organization Labs]]
- [[The Forge]]

## Modules
Each LFF proposal is made up of modules. Modules are groupings of related work. Each module is self-contained with key outputs. Modules allow individuals to self-select into interests, and to allow each to be a leader. 

Each module has a primary LFF work group. The primary work group is responsible for selecting a module leader for a set duration, and to reselect at the end of that duration.

The delivery of module outputs are the primary responsibility of the module leader. The leader is expected to deliver based on the spirit of the module. 

Others working on the module can come and go, allowing them explore without extended commitment while they [search for their Ikigai](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/A.+Whitepaper/D.+Technology%26Philosophy/The+Littlefish+Way#It+Starts+within+the+Individual). They can also commit to a module if they wish to become a team member.

Modules are in the creation phase. They are an experiment in organizational design. 

More to come...
