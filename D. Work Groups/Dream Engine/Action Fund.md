The Action Fund's purpose is to buy Actions. Littlefish Foundation is the first colony, it is the first buyer of Actions in this new ecosystem, establishing consant demand for Action. 

Deciding how the Action Fund will be utilized is a long term governance issue. 

## Purpose
LFF Action Fund has two purposes.

1.  **Contingency**  
   
    Proposals may not be funded. The activities in the proposals will still take place if we can account for this with additional funding. Action Fund will provide that funding if and when it is necessary.  
      
    ADA price is another factor of risk that must be accounted for with the Action Fund. Market conditions today are full of risk. The Action Fund accounts for this risk.  
      
    Thus, the Action Fund can be used to extend a module budget or fund an unfunded proposalsâ€™ module.  
      
    
2.  **Incentivizing further Action**  
   
    We are creating a new economy. LFF is the first colony in this economy. Its members are producing Actions, the supply. But who will buy them?  
      
    There is a need for stable demand for Actions to bootstrap this new digital economy. Action Fund provides this stable demand.
    

## Allocation size
The Action Fund allocation is sized at 1/3rd of the total [[F9 Proposal Budget#Module budgets|module budget]].

## Examples
**Proposal: 5 modules, each worth 1000 USD**
Module budget = 5000 USD
LFF Action Fund = 5000 * 0.5 = 2500 USD
Proposal Total = 7500 USD

**Proposal: 3 modules, each worth 10000 USD**
Module budget = 30000 USD
LFF Action Fund = 30000 * 0.5 = 15000 USD
Proposal Total = 45000 USD
